# Tiger-Of-Nassau-Street
Help Tony the Tiger run Hoagie Haven and save up for a Christmas gift for a special someone! ;) Happy holidays!

***
On Nassau Street, Tony the Tiger runs Hoagie Haven alone, saving up 
for a special someone. Press W to make hoagies for the day, and press
D to up the price of each hoagie. Careful! If each hoagie is too 
expensive, the customers won’t buy it, and if you make too many 
hoagies that you don’t sell, Tony will lose money. Each day, 
there is a chance for a random event, which will increase hoagie 
demand, decrease hoagie demand, or deduct a fixed amount from 
the player (this scenario will spawn a cute new addition to 
the Hoagie Haven team). Once Tony saves up enough money, 
he buys his surprise: an engagement ring for his one true love, 
the Grinch. You see the touching scene play out in beautiful 
and detailed illustrations that are guaranteed to tug at 
your heartstrings and raise your Christmas spirit.
